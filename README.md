# Travo

Companion extension that will remind you to use your TRAvel VOuchers.

Manage your travel vouchers and get reminded to use them when browsing the travel website.

It's easy to forget to use a voucher that was given due to a cancellation.
They are lost in emails or in a note and we remember then AFTER booking our ticket.

This extension is designed to notify the user when a travel voucher is available.

How it works (Eurostar example):

-   Open the extension
-   Add voucher (select Eurostar, enter expiry date and voucher code)
-   Extension will automatically map the company selected with their website.
-   Browse eurostar.com
-   A popup will appear bottow right to notify that a voucher is available.
-   Use the voucher
-   Delete the voucher.

This extension uses firefox/chrome sync capabilities so you can find your vouchers on any firefox/chrome you are logged in.
Data is stored in your browser only. Nothing leaves the extension (except Firefox sync).

This extension is still in development. Any feedback is welcome (via email or github issues), any improvement is welcome.
For now, I mainly concentrated on UK but I can add more companies on request.

Thank you for trying the extension!
